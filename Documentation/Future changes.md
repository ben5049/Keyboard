# Future Changes

## Hardware

### Left & Right Boards V2:

* Neopixels require 5V logic so include a level shifter before first Neopixel.
* Increase hole size so M2 slots can protrude through board.
* Use Kailh Choc compatible switch footprints.
* Extend the inside edges and add a screen and new MCU. The new MCU should have more pins to improve routing.
* Move status LEDs.
* Solder Neopixels correctly >:(.
* Wireless?
* Use SBU channels for communication between keyboards? This would require swapping the channels to account for different cable rotations.

### Case V2:

* Make slot for USB-A port longer by about 0.5 to 1mm.
* Make inside corners have a smaller radius.
* Make edges slightly taller so base plate doesn't contact pins.
* Lower USB-C cutouts.
* Make edges follow PCB precisely.
* Make sure tag connect is fully accessible.
* Create raised area around the base of the encoder.
